<h3>This seems to be a very easy question, ain't it?</h3>
<p class="text-justify hyphens-auto">But if you go to google and search the phrase "Application Integration", you
    will get a
    multitude of vendor
    specific sites that try to define application integration to align with their marketing philosophy, not entirely
    saying what it is. Some focus on heavy integration platforms, others around message brokers, while some also
    speak
    of API Management solutions. All of those are components that compose application integration and can be used or
    not, depending on what are the requirements and what is the architecture of a particular application, system or
    IT
    ecosystem.
</p>

<h3>Why do we pose this question?</h3>
<p class="text-justify hyphens-auto">After spending years in the field of Application Integration, we found that
    this is one of the
    most misunderstood
    and neglected areas of IT. At the same time it can be one of the most complex and interesting challenges to
    solve
    within a modern IT landscape.
</p>

<p class="text-justify hyphens-auto">We currently find that Application Integration is not taught anywhere else than
    with the technology vendors.
    And as
    it is, all their curriculums are usually limited by what they are actually selling, so some problems are either
    not
    addressed or solved in a vendor specific way, that blurs the understanding of certain application integration
    patterns and they do not show trade-offs between different solutions and architectural approaches. These are
    always
    left to be done by the customer himself.
</p>

<p class="text-justify hyphens-auto">We realized that there is an educational gap that needs to be bridged, so we
    decided to build an Application
    Integration compendium by providing perspective on different architectural styles, their trade-offs and
    integration
    patterns.
</p>

<h3>A bit of history</h3>
<p class="text-justify hyphens-auto">We think that to understand any topic is to foremost understand the why behind
    it. In case of Application
    Integration the why is hidden in its history and how communication developed over the years. <b>Why do we need
        to communicate?</b> Information was always the key in everything humankind did. The more information we had,
    the
    more power we could amass. Nowadays it is estimated that on average we consume about 34GB of media daily (not
    accounting for other information, not screen related!). Most people do not do much with that information, as
    most of
    it is forgotten in the next few days. But just understanding the capacity of our brains to process and store
    data,
    kind of shows the "why". We are information hungry! We need to exchange information all the time, because this
    is
    what we basically consume, whether this is gossip, a TV drama, or actually useful knowledge! But going back to
    Application Integration. The most basic form data exchange is a point to point (P2P) connection between two
    separate
    instances of some sort of software. In layman's terms this is a form of communication resembling a conversation
    in
    person between two people. This kind of communication was the first of its kind recognised in computer science,
    starting with the creation of <a target="_blank" class="link"
                                     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANet</a>
    and
    the first
    connection between computers in 1969 made with the <a
            target="_blank" class="link"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Control_Protocol_(ARPANET)">NCP</a> and
    later
    on in 1974 implementing the use of <a target="_blank" class="link"
                                          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP</a>.
    This is the protocol we rely on to this day, last updated in August 2022
    as
    <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9293">RFC 9293</a>.
</p>

<h3>So what is Application Integration?</h3>
<p class="text-justify hyphens-auto">Application Integration is the strive to connect different applications into a
    larger ecosystem that functions
    as
    one. But what does that mean to function as one? In essence it is the capability to provide the right data to
    the
    right place at the right time, where Application Integration defines how that data transfer should happen within
    those parameters.
</p>

<p class="text-justify hyphens-auto">As with everything that is done in IT, this can be done in a multitude of
    different ways, some better, some
    worse.
    This is the responsibility of Application Integration Architecture to answer how to build integrations between
    applications that are coherent with the overall architecture of the application or whole IT landscape.
</p>

<h4>The development of Application Integration over the years.</h4>
<p class="text-justify hyphens-auto">As we are going to dive into details in the next articles it is worth
    mentioning what is the scope of our
    interest.
    Below you will find the main areas we will be exploring in Application Integration and their particular
    characteristics.
</p>
<h5>Client - Server Application Integration</h5>
<p class="text-justify hyphens-auto">As mentioned above, the most basic form of interoperation, commonly used till
    this day and utilized by all
    applications that want to exchange data. It is a simple point to point (P2P), decentralized approach, which
    comes
    down to a single HTTP call to an interface. This is the building block of all communication onwards as all
    applications, even with middleware in place, rely on a Client-Server relationship.
</p>
<br/>
<div>Benefits:
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-7">
        <li>Fast and fairly easy to build, quick to deploy</li>
        <li>Cost effective in a small scale or short perspective</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<br/>
<div>
    Problems:
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-7">
        <li>Complexity grows exponentially with each integration</li>
        <li>Heavy impact on application code and configuration with a medium or larger scale platform</li>
        <li>Tight coupling of applications (spaghetti architecture/big ball of mud)</li>
        <li>No reusability</li>
        <li>Low or no maintainability with a larger scale</li>
        <li>Low or no proper logging and monitoring</li>
        <li>Close to no capability to refactor or introduce change fast</li>
        <li>Difficult or unavailable to work in a High Available mode</li>
        <li>Zero Trust Architecture is hard to implement</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h5>Broker Application Integration</h5>
<p class="text-justify hyphens-auto">Broker type architecture solves some key problems of the Client-Server
    Architecture, as it introduces a
    centralized
    application facilitating the integration needs in a more organized manner. Unfortunately in certain cases this
    might
    not be enough to solve all problems, as it will depend on what we're trying to achieve. This kind of
    architecture is
    commonly used in small and medium enterprises, where the number of integrated systems is low (we usually put the
    twenty here, but it is completely arbitrary). Furthermore this approach can be divided into two distinct
    patterns:
</p>

<ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-7">
    <li>Messaging Service (e.g., JMS, AMQP, MQTT) - where an application message broker is introduced to facilitate
        all
        communication between systems on an asynchronous basis. This approach is common for Event-Driven
        Architectures
        or some Microservice System Architectures, where individual containers communicate with each other on a
        publish-subscribe basis.
    </li>
    <li>Integration broker - broker type integration platforms with dedicated tooling that provide single purpose
        services tailored to the needs of each individual system. Services themselves have very limited reusability,
        but
        code reusability is enabled through code libraries and common processes.
    </li>
</ul>
<br/>
Benefits:
<ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-7">
    <li>Partially provide loose coupling of applications</li>
    <li>Code reusability possible</li>
    <li>Lower impact on application code and configuration with larger scale</li>
    <li>Maintainable, but hard to do on a large scale</li>
    <li>Enables Zero Trust Architecture to a limited extent</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Problems:
<ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-7">
    <li>Single point of failure (partially mitigated by multi node HA)</li>
    <li>None or very limited services reusability</li>
    <li>Dedicated single purpose flows</li>
    <li>Limited capability to refactor or introduce change fast</li>
    <li>Requires effort and resources to build</li>
</ul>
<h5>Orchestration-Driven Service Oriented Architecture (ODSOA) Application Integration</h5>
<p class="text-justify hyphens-auto">SOA is an architecture concept that emerged in the late 1990s and so far is the
    most successful in supporting
    large
    scale enterprise application integration, especially in organizations that are not technology driven. The
    approach
    focuses around exposing data in a standardized manner to enable creation of services providing different data
    objects or functions related to said objects (e.g. CRUD). Although it originally was built around SOAP Services
    and
    XML, it embraced RESTful Services as easily. Before the emergence of cloud-native technologies, this approach
    struggled with similar problems as the broker architectures in terms of availability and performance.
</p>
<br/>
Benefits:
<ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-7">
    <li>Provides loose coupling</li>
    <li>Major reusability (code, APIs, services)</li>
    <li>Supports Zero Trust Architecture</li>
    <li>Inline with Microservice System Architecture</li>
    <li>Highly scalable horizontally and vertically</li>
    <li>Very low impact on application code and configuration</li>
    <li>High capability to react to changes</li>
    <li>Mitigates IT landscape complexity</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Problems:
<ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-7">
    <li>Requires effort and resources to build</li>
    <li>With first integrations it may seem to increase complexity and cost (lowers with each reuse), - Requires
        highly
        trained Integration Architects to be successful
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>So what is Application Integration?</h3>
<p class="text-justify hyphens-auto">In short, this is a quite complex field that addresses the aspects of technical
    implementation of the ways we,
    and
    all technology we create, consume information.
</p>
<p class="text-justify hyphens-auto">With this short article we would like to invite you to explore the topic of
    Application Integration with us and
    dive into the complex details of different styles, approaches and architectural trade-offs that come with modern
    day
    challenges of an IT landscape.
